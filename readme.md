# **Clean Node API**

This is an API that was built entirely during a training, the objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to make the distribution of layered responsibilities, always following SOLID principles and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
